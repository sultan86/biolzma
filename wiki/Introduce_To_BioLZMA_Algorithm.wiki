= Why We Need DNA Data Compression Algorithms =

As we all know that the DNA data is very important in scientific research. It contains the complete genetic information for organismsâ€™ developing and functioning. To obtain the DNA data of various creatures, many DNA sequencing projects have been performed and huge amount of biological data has been produced, which brings a lot pressure on its storage and transmission. To deal with this rapidly expanding DNA data, we need some effective compression algorithms.

However, most of the existing general-purpose data compression algorithms have bad performance on DNA data due to its special data features (In fact, the DNA data will expand about 20% in size after "compressed" by tools like bzip2). That's why we need algorithms specific designed for DNA data compression.


= The BioLZMA Algorithm =

The BioLZMA algorithm is an effective DNA data compression algorithm proposed by Shenzhen University - Texas Instruments DSPs Laboratory (SZU-TI DSPs Lab). Comparing with some classical DNA data compression algorithms like GenCompress [http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~cssamk/gencomp/GenCompress1.htm [1]] or GeNML [http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tabus/genml/index.html [2]]
