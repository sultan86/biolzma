= Why We Need DNA Data Compression Algorithms =

As we all know that the DNA data is essential in biological and medical research. It contains the complete genetic information for organismsâ€™ developing and functioning. To obtain the DNA data of various creatures, many DNA sequencing projects have been performed and huge amount of biological data has been produced, which brings a lot pressure on its storage and transmission. To deal with this rapidly expanding DNA data, we need some effective compression techniques.

However, existing general-purpose data compression algorithms can not achieve satisfying performance on DNA data due to its intrinsic unique data features. In fact the DNA data will be expand about 20% in size after "compressed" by tools like bzip2. That's why we need to develop techniques specific designed for DNA data compression.

The first DNA data compression algorithm, namely [http://www-rocq.inria.fr/~grumbach/biocompress.html BioCompress], was proposed in 1994. After that, many new compression techniques and improvements were introduced. Algorithms like [http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~cssamk/gencomp/GenCompress1.htm GenCompress], [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.3908 CTW+LZ], [http://monod.uwaterloo.ca/downloads/dnacompress/ DNACompress] and [http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tabus/genml/index.html GeNML] have achieve significant progress in enhancing the compression rate of DNA data.


= The BioLZMA Algorithm =

The BioLZMA algorithm is an effective DNA data compression technique proposed by Shenzhen University - Texas Instruments DSPs Laboratory (SZU-TI DSPs Lab). Comparing with conventional DNA compression algorithms like GenCompress[http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~cssamk/gencomp/GenCompress1.htm [1]] and GeNML[http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tabus/genml/index.html [2]], the BioLZMA has following advantages:

   * *Simple*: BioLZMA based on existing compression techniques like Huffman coding and LZMA compression. Easy to implement.
   * *Modularity*: BioLZMA consists of several encoding sub-procedures. These procedures can be replaced or reconfigured for each compression process in order to achieve higher performance.
   * *Bioinformatics Meanings*: In BioLZMA, the DNA base symbols ('A', 'T', 'C' and 'G') will be translated into (one or several) amino acid symbols before compression. Experimental results show that by doing so, the compression rate is significantly improved. Such results indicate that the similarities between amino acid symbol fragments is higher than that in DNA sequences.
   * *High Performance*: BioLZMA can achieve higher compression rate than most of the conventional DNA data compression techniques. Here is a simple comparison (results are shown in BPB(bit per base))[http://www.cs.tut.fi/~tabus/genml/results.html [3]]:

= Procedure of BioLZMA Algorithm =

The BioLZMA algorithm consist of 3 major sub-procedures: symbols translation, precoding and LZMA compression. All of these sub-procedures can be replaced and / or reconfigured for each compression situation.

*Symbol Translation*: We notice that the similarities between amino acid sequences is stronger than that in original DNA sequence data. By treating several amino acids as a unique symbol, the fragments similarities can be further enhanced. In BioLZMA, the DNA bases will first be translated into these unique amino acid symbols. Then the translated sequences is sent to the precoder.

*Precoding*:
